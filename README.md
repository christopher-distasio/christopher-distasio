## So much of the software development world is open source, so why shouldn't SD teaching be?

### It's second nature for most teachers to share what has worked for them to engage students as well as facilitate and foster their development.

### We're all learning and some of us are either teaching each other or teaching ourselves. 

### So it just makes sense to have this attitude.


We are swept up in constant revolutions of technology and ideas. And we're at our best when we share and help each other sort through all that's out there to find the best innovations and the best practices around them.

This idea is at the core of all of the materials you'll find here. I hope they are useful, and that they inspire you to make your own.

I have taught software development skills for more than two years now, and I taught English as a Second Language all over the world for nearly two decades. 

Here's what you'll find in my repo. I've broken it down as simply as possble for you to peruse pleasantly.

You'll find many of these same topics addressed in my blog, Commcodia, which is hosted on Medium.

My own work as a software developer can be found at my stazman profile.
