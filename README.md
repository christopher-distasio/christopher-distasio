### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

We are all learning and some of us are either teaching each other or teaching ourselves. We are growing. We are swept up in constant revolutions of technology and ideas. And we're at our best when we share, and we keep this growth going for everyone.

This idea is at the core of all of the materials you'll find here. I hope they are useful, and that they inspire you to make your own.

I have taught software development skills for more than two years now, and I taught English as a Second Language all over the world for nearly two decades. 

Here's what you'll find in my repo. I've broken it down as simply as possble for you to peruse pleasantly.

You'll find many of these same topics addressed in my blog, Commcodia, which is hosted on Medium.

TBD
