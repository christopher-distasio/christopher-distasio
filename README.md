# Welcome, SD Teachers and Learners!






On this site, look for lesson materials, tools, and advice related to whatever topic you are teaching to your SD students or learning needs. There are gists based on general topics pinned to this profile. Please share your own lesson materials, tools, and advice in comments that relate to a gist. You're also welcome to make your own gist after forking this repo, cloning it, and making a pull request.


## Where I'm Coming From:

- It's second nature for most teachers to share what has worked for them to engage students as well as facilitate and foster their development.

- We're all learning and some of us are either teaching each other or teaching ourselves. 

- So it just makes sense to have this attitude.

- We're swept up in constant revolutions of technology and ideas, and we're at our best when we share and help each other sort through all that's out there to find the best innovations and the best practices around them.

- I hope you find these materials and tools useful for you, and that they inspire you to make your own. I've taught software development skills for more than two years now, and I taught English as a Second Language all over the world for nearly two decades. Here's what you'll find in my repo. I've broken it down as simply as possble for you to peruse pleasantly.

You'll find many of these same topics addressed in [Commcodia](https://commcodia.com/), my SD teaching and learning blog.

My work as a software developer not done in the context of teaching SD can be found at my [stazman](https://github.com/stazman) profile.
